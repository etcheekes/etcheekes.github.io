                        <h3>Programming education</h3>
                        <p>I first programmed using R during my PhD, and later got introduced to SQL and databases through the <a href="https://gb.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics" target="_blank">Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</a>. Next, I completed the freeCodeCamp <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/">Scientific Computing with Python</a> course. Most recently, I finished <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">Harvard's CS50x course</a> “Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming” which taught through multiple languages. </p>
                        <p>These courses provided me with the foundational knowledge to become, and grow, as a web developer, covering concepts like data types, variables, operators, conditional statements, functions, and loops. I also gained knowledge of more advanced topics like data structures, different programming paradigms, abstraction, relational databases, network protocols, web servers, and more.</p> 
                        <h3>Experience</h3>
                        <p>I have hands-on experience in multiple programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, C, SQL, and R. Likewise, I have used HTML to structure webpages and CSS to enhance their visual appearance. I have applied these skills to complete various programming assignments and projects designed to test my ability to solve real-world problems. </p>
                        <p>Further, I independently developed a web application to help people plan workout routines. This self-designed project enabled me to apply and consolidate my knowledge and skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and databases. The result was a fully functional web app that satisfies a real-world need, check it out <a href="https://lift-it.up.railway.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Future plans</h3>
                        <p>Developing Lift-It highlighted the effectiveness of project-based-learning for improving as a web developer. I gained a deeper understanding of programming concepts and their practical applications for web development. Furthermore, I learned new skills, frameworks, and concepts to accomplish the project's initial vision.</p>
                        <p>Thus, I will continue developing new projects that tackle real-world problems to reinforce my current skills, while challenging myself to apply new programming concepts and techniques to grow as web developer.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, I am eager to do web development work for someone else. If you're interested in working with me, please contact me <a href="/contact.html">here</a> or directly by email at dev.erik.c@gmail.com.</p>

                        <p>As a PhD graduate in an unrelated field, I chose to become a programmer and web developer. If you’re wondering why then please read on.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It is rewarding.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>What you can do with a computer, a programming language, and lines of code is impressive. How it works under-the-hood is fascinating. Creating a program or website that helps yourself or others is, simply put, rewarding.</p>
                        <ol start="2">
                            <li>The process is captivating and satisfying.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Programming can be frustrating; however, its process is equally captivating and satisfying. It invites creativity as one applies programming concepts from your toolkit in differing ways to solve problems and create. Furthermore, improving at this process adds another layer of satisfaction.</p>
                        <ol start="3">
                            <li>My academic experience transfers over.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Through completing my PhD I became an expert researcher, acquired a strong drive to succeed, cultivated discipline, and honed my ability to persevere through difficult problems until finding a solution. These skills and traits empowered me to learn programming and web development while also positioning me well to continue honing my craft.</p>
